Overall requirements:

 - spaced repetition
	"As a student, I want questions to be asked in a
	spaced reptition way so that I spend more time
	learning the unfamiliar ones and less time
	reviewing the ones I know well."

 - add and remove questions
	"As a teacher, I would like to be able to add
	new questions so that students can learn new things."

	"As a teacher, I would like to be able to update
	existing questions so that errors or omissions can
	be corrected."

	"As a teacher, I would like to be able to remove
	questions so that students are no longer asked
	about things that are wrong or irrelevant."

 - questions should have multi-directionality. i.e. if an item has
   multiple bits of information (chemical symbol, chemical name, atomic
   number, atomic weight, &c), should be able to show one and ask
   another ("What is the atomic number of the element with the symbol Hg?")

	"As a teacher, I would like students to be shown
	any one aspect of a question and required to answer
	another aspect so that the student is able to think
	of multiple sides of an item."

 - organize questions into topics

	"As a teacher I would like to be able to group related
	questions together so that students can concentrate
	on one topic at a time."

 - allow for multiple students

	"As a teacher, I would like to keep track of multiple
	students so that I can track their progress individually."
